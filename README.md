# outadoc's Advent of Code
Personal Advent of Code solutions written in Kotlin.

Obviously these aren't necessarily the optimal solutions, but they're mine. Users beware.

## Running stuff
With a Kotlin â‰¥ 1.4 executable:

```
kotlin 2020/day5.ws.kts
```

If you don't have the `kotlin` runner yet:

```
# For macOS
brew install kotlin
```
